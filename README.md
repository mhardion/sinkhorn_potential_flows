# Sinkhorn Potential Flow Numerics.
Numerics for the article "Gradient Flows of Potential Energies in the Geometry of Sinkhorn divergences" ([HAL preprint](https://hal.science/hal-05368523)) with [Hugo Lavenant](https://hugolav.github.io). The notebook `sinkhorn_potential_flows.ipynb` contains the exact parameters used to produce the figures. The module `spf` is made to compute the flow (in `pyTorch` Tensors) and display it using `plotly`. The folder `saved_flows` contains precomputed versions of the flows so that one does not have to wait for the code to execute as it can take some time. The folder `animations` contains the interactive `plotly` animations as html files which can be read by any browser. The computational method and the figures are detailed in Section 8 of the article.
